*July 28,2021*

Our team recently needed the ability to spin up a [supabase.io](http://supabase.io) back end for local development.  After some trial and error I came up with a working solution mostly based on the Supabase [repo](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) but with some quality of life modifications and removing services we didn't use.
I write about what I ended up doing [here](posts/2021_07_28_cloning_supabaseio_for_local_development.md).
